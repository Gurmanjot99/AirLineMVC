        <h2>Hauraki Gulf Islands</h2>
        <p>
            Your flight to NZ from India lands you in Auckland, where you can catch a ferry to Waiheke Island for zip-line adventures and wine tours. Another great adventure in the Hauraki Gulf is Rangitoto, a volcanic island. You can hike to the summit for wonderful 360° views of the city, harbour and gulf. There are also lava caves to explore on Rangitoto.

        <h2>Waitomo Caves</h2>
        <p>
            At Waitomo, you can journey underground to see glow worms and magnificent limestone formations. A really exciting way to see the caves is on a black water rafting tour, where you’ll float along underground streams on an inflatable tube. You can combine Waitomo with a trip to the Hobbiton movie set.
